@article{woods_2017,
	Abstract = {Psychophysical experiments conducted remotely over the internet permit data collection from large numbers of participants, but sacrifice control over sound presentation, and therefore are not widely employed in hearing research. To help standardize online sound presentation, we introduce a brief psychophysical test for determining if online experiment participants are wearing headphones. Listeners judge which of three pure tones is quietest, with one of the tones presented 180$\,^{\circ}$ out of phase across the stereo channels. This task is intended to be easy over headphones but difficult over loudspeakers due to phase-cancellation. We validated the test in the lab by testing listeners known to be wearing headphones or listening over loudspeakers. The screening test was effective and efficient, discriminating between the two modes of listening with a small number of trials. When run online, a bimodal distribution of scores was obtained, suggesting that some participants performed the task over loudspeakers despite instructions to use headphones. The ability to detect and screen out these participants mitigates concerns over sound quality for online experiments, a first step toward opening auditory perceptual research to the possibilities afforded by crowdsourcing.},

@article{flege_1992,
	Abstract = {Four experiments were carried out to examine listener‐ and talker‐related factors that may influence degree of perceived foreign accent. In each, native English listeners rated English sentences for degree of accent. It was found that degree of accent is influenced by range effects. The larger the proportion of native (or near‐native) speakers included in a set of sentences being evaluated, the more strongly accented listeners judged sentences spoken by non‐native speakers to be. Foreign accent ratings were not stable. Listeners judged a set of non‐native‐produced sentences to be more strongly accented after, as compared to before, they became familiar with those sentences. One talker‐related effect noted in the study was the finding that adults' pronunciation of an L2 may improve over time. Late L2 learners who had lived in the United States for an average of 14.3 years received significantly higher scores than late learners who had resided in the United States for 0.7 years. Another talker‐related effect pertained to the age of L2 learning ({AOL}). Native Spanish subjects with an {AOL} of five to six years were not found to have an accent (i.e., to receive significantly lower scores than native English speakers), whereas native Chinese subjects with an average {AOL} of 7.6 year d i d have a measurable accent. The paper concludes with the presentation of several hypotheses concerning the relationship between {AOL} and degree of foreign accent.},

@article{sprouse_2010,
	Abstract = {Amazon's Mechanical Turk ({AMT}) is a Web application that provides instant access to thousands of potential participants for survey-based psychology experiments, such as the acceptability judgment task used extensively in syntactic theory. Because {AMT} is a Web-based system, syntacticians may worry that the move out of the experimenter-controlled environment of the laboratory and onto the user-controlled environment of {AMT} could adversely affect the quality of the judgment data collected. This article reports a quantitative comparison of two identical acceptability judgment experiments, each with 176 participants (352 total): one conducted in the laboratory, and one conducted on {AMT}. Crucial indicators of data quality---such as participant rejection rates, statistical power, and the shape of the distributions of the judgments for each sentence type---are compared between the two samples. The results suggest that aside from slightly higher participant rejection rates, {AMT} data are almost indistinguishable from laboratory data.},

	Abstract = {Phonological distance can be measured computationally using formally specified algorithms. This work investigates two such measures, one developed by  based on Levenshtein distance () and the other an adaptation of  language classifier that uses maximum likelihood distance. These two measures are compared against na{\"\i}ve transcriptions of the speech of pediatric cochlear implant users. The new measure, maximum likelihood distance, correlates highly with Levenshtein distance and na{\"\i}ve transcriptions; results from this corpus are easier to obtain since cochlear implant speech has a lower intelligibility than the usually high intelligibility of the speech of a different dialect.},

@book{chomsky_1995,
	Abstract = {The Minimalist Program consists of four recent essays that attempt to situate linguistic theory in the broader cognitive sciences. In these essays the minimalist approach to linguistic theory is formulated and progressively developed. Building on the theory of principles and parameters and, in particular, on principles of economy of derivation and representation, the minimalist framework takes Universal Grammar as providing a unique computational system, with derivations driven by morphological properties, to which the syntactic variation of languages is also restricted. Within this theoretical framework, linguistic expressions are generated by optimally efficient derivations that must satisfy the conditions that hold on interface levels, the only levels of linguistic representation. The interface levels provide instructions to two types of performance systems, articulatory-perceptual and conceptual-intentional. All syntactic conditions, then, express properties of these interface levels, reflecting the interpretive requirements of language and keeping to very restricted conceptual resources.

	Abstract = {The recent hypothesis that L1 attrition affects the ability to process interface structures but not knowledge representations (Sorace, 2011) is tested by investigating the effects of recent L1 re-exposure on antecedent preferences for Spanish pronominal subjects, using offline judgements and online eye-tracking measures. Participants included a group of native Spanish speakers experiencing L1 attrition (`attriters'), a second group of attriters exposed exclusively to Spanish before they were tested (`re-exposed'), and a control group of Spanish monolinguals. The judgement data shows no significant differences between the groups. Moreover, the monolingual and re-exposed groups are not significantly different from each other in the eye-tracking data. The results of this novel manipulation indicate that attrition effects decrease due to L1 re-exposure, and that bilinguals are sensitive to input changes. Taken together, the findings suggest that attrition affects online sensitivity with interface structures rather than causing a permanent change in speakers' L1 knowledge representations.},

@article{munro_1999,
	Abstract = {Anecdotal evidence suggests that adults who move from one dialect area to another begin to acquire some of the speech characteristics of the second dialect (or ``D2''). We put this observation to an empirical test in the present study by examining the speech of Canadians who have moved to Birmingham, Alabama. Speech samples produced by these people, as well as by native Alabamans and Canadians who had not emigrated were rated by two groups of listeners. This form of evaluation allowed us to determine whether dialect acquisition, if any, was perceptible. The fact that listeners from both Canada and Alabama reliably rated the speech of Canadians who had moved to Alabama as exhibiting an intermediate degree of ``American accent'' indicates that adults can indeed acquire the phonetic aspects of a D2 to the extent that listeners from both the first dialect and D2 areas can distinguish them from other native speakers of either dialect. A follow-up analysis allowed us to pinpoint some specific phonetic properties of the migrant group's speech that may have played a role in the listeners' judgments. In several respects these findings parallel the results of studies of second-language phonetic learning in adults.},

@inproceedings{weinberger_2019,
	Abstract = {Phonetic transcription is a crucial component for phonetic analysis, and phonetic analysis is prerequisite for
pronunciation teaching. But training humans to produce accurate transcriptions is time consuming and labor
intensive. This is especially the case since most accurate and reliable transcribed renditions of human speech result
from a process of consensus from multiple trained human transcribers, and the more human listeners, the better.
We report on a project to crowdsource this process. Primarily, we sought a method to deal with the transcription
backlog in an online corpus of more than 2,800 accented English speech samples. Crowdsourcing for phonetic
transcription has not been attempted and we set out to investigate such a procedure. Research questions consisted
of three issues: 1) does crowdsourcing work for narrow transcription? 2) does transcriber phonetic ability matter?
3) does transcriber native language matter? The task was simple: listen to some L2 speech, then transcribe it. Each
sample was taken from the speech accent archive. The crowd included students from around the world. We
catalogued 358 qualified submissions. There were 97 transcribers who submitted multiple transcriptions. Selfreported transcription proficiency varied: 24 advanced, 35 intermediate, and 38 beginners. Transcribers were from
21 different language backgrounds. Because the archive contains vetted transcriptions of hundreds of speech
samples, we used these as temporary ``gold standards'' to test the accuracy of the crowd. Indeed, 1) the
crowdsourced transcriptions matched the gold standard at a rate of 70\%. Mixed-effects logistic regression was
employed on the rest of the data, and results indicate that 2) there is a tendency that phonetic ability does matter,
and 3) native language background does not significantly matter. We demonstrate that crowdsourced phonetic
transcription is possible. We also report on the implications for diagnostic studies of second language speech, and
the efficacy of training human transcribers.},

	Abstract = {Natural speech consonant-vowel ({CV}) syllables [( f, s, theta, s, v, z, {\u o}] followed by [i, u, a]) were computer edited to include 20-70 ms of their frication noise in 10-ms steps as measured from their onset, as well as the entire frication noise. These stimuli, and the entire syllables, were presented to 12 subjects for consonant identification. Results show that the listener does not require the entire fricative-vowel syllable in order to correctly perceive a fricative. The required frication duration depends on the particular fricative, ranging from approximately 30 ms for [s, z] to 50 ms for [f, s, v], while [theta, {\u o}] are identified with reasonable accuracy in only the full frication and syllable conditions. Analysis in terms of the linguistic features of voicing, place, and manner of articulation revealed that fricative identification in terms of place of articulation is much more affected by a decrease in frication duration than identification in terms of voicing and manner of articulation.},

@article{chodroff_2017,
	Abstract = {Variation across talkers in the acoustic-phonetic realization of speech sounds is a pervasive property of spoken language. The present study provides evidence that variation across talkers in the realization of American English stop consonants is highly structured. Positive voice onset time ({VOT}) was examined for all six word-initial stop categories in isolated productions of {CVC} syllables and in a multi-talker corpus of connected read speech. The mean {VOT} for each stop differed considerably across talkers, replicating previous findings, but importantly there were strong and statistically significant linear relations among the means (e.g., the mean {VOTs} of [pʰ] and [kʰ] were highly correlated across talkers, r{\textgreater}0.80). The pattern of {VOT} covariation was not reducible to differences in speaking rate or other factors known to affect the realization of stop consonants. These findings support a uniformity constraint on the talker-specific realization of a phonetic property, such as glottal spreading, that is shared by multiple speech sounds. Because uniformity implies mutual predictability, the findings also shed light on listeners׳ ability to generalize knowledge of a novel talker from one stop consonant to another. More broadly, structured variation of the kind investigated here indicates a relatively low-dimensional encoding of talker-specific phonetic realization in both speech production and speech perception.},

@article{carignan_2017,
	Abstract = {In a variety of languages, changes in tongue height and breathiness have been observed to covary with nasalization in both phonetic and phonemic vowel nasality. It has been argued that this covariation stems from speakers using multiple articulations to enhance F1 modulation and/or from listeners misperceiving the articulatory basis for F1 modification. This study includes results from synchronous nasalance, ultrasound, {EGG}, and F1 data related to the realizations of the oral--nasal vowel pairs /ɛ/-/ɛ̃/, /a/-/ɑ̃/, and /o/-/ɔ̃/ of Southern French ({SF}) as produced by four male speakers in a laboratory setting. The aim of the study is to determine to what extent tongue height and breathiness covary with nasalization, as well as how these articulations affect the realization of F1. The following evidence is observed: (1) that nasalization, breathiness, and tongue height are used in idiosyncratic ways to distinguish F1 for each vowel pair; (2) that increased nasalization and breathiness significantly predict F1-lowering for all three nasal vowels; (3) that nasalization increases throughout the duration of the nasal vowels, supporting previous claims about the temporal nature of nasality in {SF} nasal vowels, but contradicting claims that {SF} nasal vowels comprise distinct oral and nasal elements; (4) that breathiness increases in a gradient manner as nasalization increases; and (5) that the acoustic and articulatory data provide limited support for claims of the existence of an excrescent nasal coda in {SF} nasal vowels. These results are discussed in the light of claims that the multiple articulatory components observed in the production of vowel nasalization may have arisen due to misperception-based sound change and/or to phonetic enhancement.},

@article{wayland_1997,
	Abstract = {This paper reports a study of the production of Thai vowels, consonants, and tones by native English speakers using two forms of evaluation acoustic measurements and auditory evaluation by native Thai-speaking listeners The investigation focused on (a) the acoustic parameters along which the two groups of speakers differ, and (b) which of these acoustic parameters influenced native listeners' judgments of perceived degree of accentedness
Three native Thai speakers and 6 native English speakers were tape recorded in an oral reading task Speech analysis showed that the two groups of speakers differed more along the spectral dimension (namely formant frequencies and fundamental frequency) than the temporal dimension (namely voice-onset time and vowel duration) When the productions of both the native speakers and the non-native speakers were rated for accentedness, the rating data showed that non-native production were rated for accentedness, the rating data showed that non-native production can be readily distinguished from native production Only some non-native tokens were judged as `native-like' Moreover, the rating scores for the non-native speakers were lower in level tones than contour tones, suggesting different degrees of difficulty for each tone When the acoustic data were regressed on the rating data, significant predictors were spectral in nature and were found mostly for level tones Moreover, no correlation between years of experience with That and the rating scores was found.
Results are discussed in terms of a `holistic' versus an `analytic' approach in tone processing by adults, inherent acoustic characteristics of individual tones as well as quantity and quality of the native input Furthermore, the fact that some non-native tokens were judged as `native-like' seems to challenge the claim that segmental as well as suprasegmental errors arise from the loss of ability to learn non-native sounds},

	Abstract = {Spoken language is characterized by an enormous amount of variability in how linguistic segments are realized. In order to investigate how speech perceptual processes accommodate to multiple sources of variation, adult native speakers of American English were trained with English words or sentences produced by six Spanish-accented talkers. At test, listeners transcribed utterances produced by six familiar or unfamiliar Spanish-accented talkers. With only brief exposure, listeners perceptually adapted to accent-general regularities in spoken language, generalizing to novel accented words and sentences produced by unfamiliar accented speakers. Acoustic properties of vowel production and their relation to identification performance were assessed to determine if the English listeners were sensitive to systematic variation in the realization of accented vowels. Vowels that showed the most improvement after Spanish-accented training were distinct from nearby vowels in terms of their acoustic characteristics. These findings suggest that the speech perceptual system dynamically adjusts to the acoustic consequences of changes in talker's voice and accent.},

When a variety of acoustic measurements, including vowel durations, F1 and F2 frequencies, and movement in F1 and F2 were examined, the two groups were found to differ on at least one of these parameters for nearly every vowel considered. A subset of the Arabic speakers' productions, and the productions of two native English speakers, were rated for accentedness by five native English judges. The rating data indicated that only a minority of the Arabic group's productions were regarded by the judges as ``native-like''. When the acoustic measurement data were regressed on the mean ratings, it was found that the accentedness scores were correlated primarily with F1 frequency and movement in F2, although the significant predictors varied from vowel to vowel.},

@article{kuhl_1991,
	Abstract = {Many perceptual categories exhibit internal structure in which category prototypes play an important role. In the four experiments reported here, the internal structure of phonetic categories was explored in studies involving adults, infants, and monkeys. In Experiment 1, adults rated the category goodness of 64 variants of the vowel /i/ on a scale from 1 to 7. The results showed that there was a certain location in vowel space where listeners rated the /i/ vowels as best instances, or prototypes. The perceived goodness of Iii vowels declined systematically as stimuli were further removed from the prototypic Iii vowel. Experiment 2 went beyond this initial demonstration and examined the effect of speech prototypes on perception. Either the prototypic or a nonprototypic {IM} vowel was used as the referent stimulus and adults' generalization to other members of the category was examined. Results showed that the typicality of the speech stimulus strongly affected perception. When the prototype of the category served as the referent vowel, there was significantly greater generalization to other /i/ vowels, relative to the situation in which the nonprototype served as the referent. The notion of aperceptual magnet was introduced. The prototype of the category functioned like a perceptual magnet for other category members; it assimilated neighboring stimuli, effectively pulling them toward the prototype. In Experiment 3, the ontogenetic origins of the perceptual magnet effect were explored by testing 6-month-old infants. The results showed that infants' perception of vowels was also strongly affected by speech prototypes. Infants showed significantly greater generalization when the prototype of the vowel category served as the referent; moreover, their responses were highly correlated with those of adults. In Experiment 4, Rhesus monkeys were tested to examine whether or not the prototype's magnet effect was unique to humans. The animals did not provide any evidence of speech prototypes; they did not exhibit the magnet effect. It is suggested that the internal organization of phonetic categories around prototypic members is an ontogenetically early, species-specific, aspect of the speech code},

	Abstract = {Speech perception ({SP}) most commonly refers to the perceptual mapping from the highly variable acoustic speech signal to a linguistic representation, whether it be phonemes, diphones, syllables, or words. This is an example of categorization, in that potentially discriminable speech sounds are assigned to functionally equivalent classes. In this tutorial, we present some of the main challenges to our understanding of the categorization of speech sounds and the conceptualization of {SP} that has resulted from these challenges. We focus here on issues and experiments that define open research questions relevant to phoneme categorization, arguing that {SP} is best understood as perceptual categorization, a position that places {SP} in direct contact with research from other areas of perception and cognition.},

The euclidean distance based on first and second formant frequencies (F1 and F2), the durational differences, as well as the perceptual judgment of the tense-lax vowel contrast were examined in the syllable level productions of 40 Mandarin speakers compared to 40 American English speakers. Results of the comparative analysis indicated that Mandarin speakers differed significantly from the American English speakers in distinguishing the English tense/lax contrast. The general pattern shown across the Mandarin subjects was one in which the temporal feature, rather than the spectral feature, was more indicative of the tense-lax contrast as compared to the American speakers. In addition, the perception for the tense-lax contrast produced by Mandarin speakers was less distinctive as compared to the American speakers. The phonetic influences of the Mandarin language on the production of English tense-lax vowels are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Languages differ in the constitution of their phonemic repertoire and in the relative distinctiveness of phonemes within the repertoire. In the present study, we asked whether such differences constrain spoken-word recognition, via two word reconstruction experiments, in which listeners turned nonwords into real words by changing single sounds. The experiments were carried out in Dutch (which has a relatively balanced vowel---consonant ratio and many similar vowels) and in Spanish (which has many more consonants than vowels and high distinctiveness among the vowels). Both Dutch and Spanish listeners responded significantly faster and more accurately when required to change vowels as opposed to consonants; when allowed to change any phoneme, they more often altered vowels than consonants. Vowel information thus appears to constrain lexical selection less tightly (allow more potential candidates) than does consonant information, independent of language-specific phoneme repertoire and of relative distinctiveness of vowels.},

	Abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between experienced {SPEAK} Test raters' judgments of nonnative pronunciation and actual deviance in segmentals, prosody, and syllable structure. Sixty reading passage speech samples from {SPEAK} Test tapes of speakers from 11 language groups were rated impressionistically on pronunciation and later analyzed for deviance in segmentals, prosody, and syllable structure. The deviance found in each area of pronunciation was then correlated with the pronunciation ratings using Pearson correlations and multiple regression. An analysis of the 60 speakers showed that whereas deviance in segmentals, prosody, and syllable structure all showed a significant influence on the pronunciation ratings, the prosodic variable proved to have the strongest effect. When separate analyses were done on two language subgroups within the sample, prosody was always found to be significantly related to the global ratings, whereas this was not always true for the other variables investigated.},

@article{guy_1991,
	Abstract = {{ABSTRACTVariationist} treatments of phonological processes typically provide precise quantitative accounts of the effects of conditioning environmental factors on the occurrence of the process, and these effects have been shown to be robust for several well-studied processes. But comparable precision in theoretical explanation is usually elusive, at the current state of the discipline. That is, the analyst is usually unable to say why the parameters should have the particular values that they do, although one can often explain relative ordering of environments. This article attempts to give a precise explanation --- in the form of a quantitative theoretical prediction --- of one robust quantitative observation about English phonology. The reduction of final consonant clusters (often called -t,d deletion) is well-known to be conditioned by the morphological structure of a target word. Deletion applies more in monomorphemic words (e.g., mist) than in inflected words (e.g., missed). In the theory of lexical phonology, these classes of words are differentiated by derivational history, acquiring their final clusters at different levels of the morphology. The theory further postulates that rules may apply at more than one level of the derivation. If -t,d deletion is treated as a variable rule with a fixed rate of application (p0) in a phonology with this architecture, then higher rates of application in underived forms (where the final cluster is present underlyingly and throughout the derivation) are a consequence of multiple exposures to the deletion rule, whereas inflected forms (which only meet the structural description of the rule late in the derivation) have fewer exposures and lower cumulative deletion. This further allows a precise quantitative prediction concerning surface deletion rates in the different morphological categories. They should be related as an exponential function of p0, depending on the number of exposures to the rule. The prediction is empirically verified in a study of -t,d deletion in seven English speakers.},

	Abstract = {Human learners, including infants, are highly sensitive to structure in their environment. Statistical learning refers to the process of extracting this structure. A major question in language acquisition in the past few decades has been the extent to which infants use statistical learning mechanisms to acquire their native language. There have been many demonstrations showing infants' ability to extract structures in linguistic input, such as the transitional probability between adjacent elements. This paper reviews current research on how statistical learning contributes to language acquisition. Current research is extending the initial findings of infants' sensitivity to basic statistical information in many different directions, including investigating how infants represent regularities, learn about different levels of language, and integrate information across situations. These current directions emphasize studying statistical language learning in context: within language, within the infant learner, and within the environment as a whole. {WIREs} Cogn Sci 2010 1 906-914 This article is categorized under: Linguistics {\textgreater} Language Acquisition Psychology {\textgreater} Language.},

	Abstract = {The present study investigated whether native listeners can detect a foreign accent in short, slightly accented utterances and also whether such information is related to the non-native talkers' native language (L1) phonotactics in terms of segments and syllable structures. To answer these questions, we examined eight native listeners' sensitivity (d′ values) to a foreign accent in a two-alternative forced choice task. Four L1 Korean learners of L2 English with high L2 proficiency along with two native speakers of English produced the test materials consisting of monosyllabic English utterances. The monosyllabic corpus included stimuli having both permissible ({CV} and {CVC}) and impermissible syllable structures ({CCV} and {CCVC}) in the non-native talkers' L1. The singleton onsets consisted of various segments in terms of Korean phonotactics and the cluster onsets included /l/ or /ɹ/. The results indicated that all the listeners detected a foreign accent from hearing the monosyllabic stimuli. Furthermore, the listeners detected a foreign accent more often from the stimuli with ``new'' L2 segments than those with ``similar'' L2 segments, regardless of syllable structure types. The present study demonstrates the L1 segmental phonotactics effects in foreign accent detection. The present study also supports and further demonstrates Flege (1984)'s finding that listeners are sensitive to foreign accent and that they do not need much information (e.g., sentences) to detect a foreign accent, even in proficient L2 learners' productions.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of the present study is to assess the contribution of various phonetic and phonological factors to the perception of global foreign accent. Two native Spanish speakers of fluent but heavily accented English recorded English phrases containing sounds or sequences of sounds whose production is characteristically difficult for native speakers of Spanish. Investigated factors included: those affecting syllable structure (initial epenthetic schwa, non-initial epenthetic schwa (-ed ending)); those affecting vowel quality (vowel reduction, tense-laxness); those affecting consonants (final /s/ deletion, manner (/t∫−∫/), fricative voicing (/z-s/), stop voicing); and those affecting stress (lexical stress and phrasal stress). English-speaking listeners rated extent of foreign accent of the Spanish phrases as originally produced and as edited acoustically. Listeners were sensitive to syllable structure factors, final /s/ deletion, consonant manner, and lexical and phrasal stress, but were not sensitive to voicing differences.},

English with an Accent:  focuses on language variation linked to geography and social identity looks at how the media and the entertainment industry work to promote linguistic stereotyping examines how employers discriminate on the basis of accent reveals how the judicial system protects the status quo and reinforces language subordination  This fascinating and highly readable book forces us to acknowledge the ways in which language is used to discriminate.},
